# Flipper Zero Firmware Documentation

## Hello world

This is a filler page for the homepage of our documentation for the time being, as I haven't yet had the time to write a proper introduction.

Here's a code block just to see how it looks:
  
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
    printf("Hello world!");
    return 0;
  }
  ```

Some formatted text:

* This is a list
* With two items
* And a third one

**This is bold text**, *this is italic text*, and `this is monospace text`.

Looks nice, doesn't it?
